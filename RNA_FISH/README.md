## RNA-FISH ANALYSIS
### Fiji Macros

Fiji macros automate the counting of the number of dots corresponding to REV-ERBα, CRY2 and TP53 transcripts in the nucleus and cytoplasm of AC16 and U2OS cells exposed to 18°C for 5h or 24h and subsequent rewarming back to 37°C for 2h from deconvolved RNA-FISH images deposited at Image Data Resource (http://idr.openmicroscopy.org) under accession number idr0089.

### R scripts

R scripts process the Results.csv files generated by the Fiji macros to generate bar charts and statistical analyses presented in Fig. 4 and the source data file of the paper.
