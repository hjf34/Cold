## TRANSCRIPTOMICS ANALYSIS
### BamToBigwigs
RNA samples from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of AC16 and U2OS cells exposed to different temperature conditions were generated into libraries using the QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit for Ion Torrent (Lexogen). Libraries were sequenced using the Ion Proton Sequencer and aligned to the hg19 human genome build or a combined dm6 (*D. melanogaster*) / hg19 genome build (for *D. melanogaster* cell spiked in samples) using the TMAP aligner with alignment settings (-tmap mapall stage1 map4) to generate bam files. Bam file reads were narrowed

### Fiji Macros

Fiji macros automate the counting of the number of dots corresponding to *REV-ERBα*, *CRY2* and *TP53* transcripts in the nucleus and cytoplasm of AC16 and U2OS cells exposed to 18°C for 5h or 24h and subsequent rewarming back to 37°C for 2h from deconvolved RNA-FISH images deposited at Image Data Resource (http://idr.openmicroscopy.org) under accession number idr0089.

### R scripts

R scripts process the Results.csv files generated by the Fiji macros to generate bar charts and statistical analyses presented in Fig. 4 and the source data file of the paper.
